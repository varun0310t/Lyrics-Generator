1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I am not the only traveler

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Who is not repaid his debt?

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I've been searching for a trail to follow

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Again, take me back to the nightmare

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Then that I can't tell myself

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 What the hell I'm supposed to do?

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Then that I can't tell myself

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Not to ride alone with you

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I head on and then I'll see you swimming down there

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Take me back to the nightmare

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I don't know what I'm supposed to do

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 You're crawling by the gusty

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 We'll be taking me back to the nightmare

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 When the night was full of terror

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Then your eyes were filled with tears

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 When your head not touched me head

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Take me back to the nightmare

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I head on and then I'll see you swimming down there

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Take me back to the nightmare

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I don't know what I'm supposed to do

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I head on and then I'll see you

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Take me back to the nightmare

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I head on and then I'll see you swimming down there
